# ‚úÖ Final Integration Checklist

## üîÑ Step 1: Merge API Routes

### For Patient App (`app_patient.py`):
1. **Open your existing `yarab/app.py`**
2. **Copy ALL your API routes** (everything with `@app.route('/api/...')`)
3. **Paste them into `app_patient.py`** in the section marked:
   ```python
   # =============================================================================
   # PATIENT API ROUTES - COPY FROM YOUR EXISTING yarab/app.py
   # =============================================================================
   ```

### For Staff App (`app_staff.py`):
1. **Open your existing `yarab/app1.py`**
2. **Copy ALL your API routes** (everything with `@app.route('/api/...')`)
3. **Paste them into `app_staff.py`** in the section marked:
   ```python
   # =============================================================================
   # STAFF API ROUTES - COPY FROM YOUR EXISTING yarab/app1.py
   # =============================================================================
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Keep Static Routes at Bottom
Make sure the static serving routes are **ALWAYS at the very bottom**:
```python
# This MUST be the last route in both files
@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def serve_patient_app(path):  # or serve_staff_app(path)
    # ... static serving logic
```

## üöÄ Step 2: Run Both Servers

### Terminal A (Patient):
```bash
python app_patient.py
# ‚úÖ Should show: Running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Terminal B (Staff):
```bash
python app_staff.py
# ‚úÖ Should show: Running on http://localhost:5001
```

## üß™ Step 3: Test Flow

### Test Patient App (http://localhost:5000):
- [ ] **Book Appointment**: Fill form, submit ‚Üí Check Flask logs for POST to `/api/patient/book`
- [ ] **Track Appointment**: Search by ticket/ID ‚Üí Check Flask logs for GET to `/api/patient/appointments`
- [ ] **Upload Files**: Test image/voice upload ‚Üí Check Flask logs for file handling
- [ ] **Database**: Verify data appears in your SQLite database

### Test Staff App (http://localhost:5001):
- [ ] **Login**: Enter credentials ‚Üí Check Flask logs for POST to `/api/login/staff`
- [ ] **List Appointments**: View appointments ‚Üí Check Flask logs for GET to `/api/appointments`
- [ ] **Edit Status**: Update appointment status ‚Üí Check Flask logs for PUT to `/api/appointments/{id}`
- [ ] **Delete**: Remove appointment ‚Üí Check Flask logs for DELETE to `/api/appointments/{id}`
- [ ] **Export CSV**: Download export ‚Üí Check Flask logs for GET to `/api/appointments`
- [ ] **Capacity**: Update daily limits ‚Üí Check Flask logs for PUT to `/api/capacity/{day}`
- [ ] **Database**: Verify all changes appear in your SQLite database

## üìÅ Step 4: Verify Uploads

### Check Upload Routes:
Both apps should have routes like:
```python
@app.route('/uploads/images/<filename>')
def uploaded_image(filename):
    return send_from_directory('yarab/uploads/images', filename)

@app.route('/uploads/voices/<filename>')
def uploaded_voice(filename):
    return send_from_directory('yarab/uploads/voices', filename)
```

### Test Upload Flow:
- [ ] **Upload**: Patient uploads image/voice ‚Üí File saved to `yarab/uploads/`
- [ ] **Display**: Staff views appointment ‚Üí Image/voice loads from `/uploads/...`
- [ ] **Direct Access**: Test `http://localhost:5000/uploads/images/filename.jpg`

## üîç Step 5: Watch Flask Logs

### What You Should See:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Sep/2025 06:47:23] "GET /api/patient/appointments?ticket=T-2024-001 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Sep/2025 06:47:45] "POST /api/patient/book HTTP/1.1" 201 -
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Sep/2025 06:48:12] "GET /api/appointments?status=pending HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Sep/2025 06:48:30] "PUT /api/appointments/123 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### What You Should NOT See:
- ‚ùå CORS errors
- ‚ùå 404s on `/api/...` routes
- ‚ùå Mock/placeholder data responses
- ‚ùå Requests to `localhost:5173` or `localhost:5174`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If API Routes Don't Work:
1. **Check Route Order**: Static routes must be at the bottom
2. **Check Route Paths**: Ensure they start with `/api/`
3. **Check Flask Logs**: Look for 404 errors
4. **Check Database**: Verify your DB connection code is included

### If Static Files Don't Load:
1. **Check Build**: Ensure `patient/dist/` and `staff/dist/` exist
2. **Check Path**: Verify `PATIENT_DIST` and `STAFF_DIST` point correctly
3. **Check Route Order**: Static serving must be last

### If Uploads Don't Work:
1. **Check Upload Directory**: Ensure `yarab/uploads/` exists
2. **Check Permissions**: Flask needs read access to upload folder
3. **Check Routes**: Verify `/uploads/...` routes are defined

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

- [ ] **No CORS errors** in browser console
- [ ] **Real API calls** in Flask logs (not mocks)
- [ ] **Database updates** when creating/editing appointments
- [ ] **File uploads** working and accessible
- [ ] **React routing** working (can refresh pages)
- [ ] **Both apps** running on different ports
- [ ] **Staff authentication** working with cookies

## üéØ Final Verification

### Patient App (http://localhost:5000):
- [ ] Can book new appointments
- [ ] Can track existing appointments
- [ ] Can upload images and voice notes
- [ ] All data persists in database

### Staff App (http://localhost:5001):
- [ ] Can login with credentials
- [ ] Can view all appointments
- [ ] Can update appointment status
- [ ] Can delete appointments
- [ ] Can export appointments to CSV
- [ ] Can manage daily capacity
- [ ] Can view uploaded files
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
