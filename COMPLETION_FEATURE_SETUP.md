   - Click "Mark as Completed"

2. **View Completion Times:**
   - Completion Hour column shows when appointment was completed
   - Shows "‚Äî" for pending appointments
   - Shows actual time (e.g., "14:30") for completed appointments

3. **Export Data:**

   - Shows actual completion times or "‚Äî" for pending

### **API Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Manual time completion
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/appointments/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "completed",
    "use_now": false,
    "completion_hour": "16:05",
    "procedures_done": "Filling and cleaning"
  }'

# Use current time completion
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/appointments/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "completed",
    "use_now": true,
    "procedures_done": "Routine checkup"
  }'
```

## üß™ Testing

### **Run the Test Script:**
```bash

```

1. Start Flask servers:
   ```bash
   python app_patient.py   # port 5000
   python app_staff.py     # port 5001
   ```

2. Open staff app: http://localhost:5001
3. Login with admin/admin
4. Try completing an appointment with both time methods
5. Verify completion hour appears in table
6. Test CSV export includes completion times
